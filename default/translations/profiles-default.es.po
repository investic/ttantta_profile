"A <em>page</em>, similar in form to a <em>story</em>, is a simple method for "
"creating and displaying information that rarely changes, such as an \"About "
"us\" section of a website. By default, a <em>page</em> entry does not allow "
"visitor comments and is not featured on the site's initial home page."

"A <em>story</em>, similar in form to a <em>page</em>, is ideal for creating "
"and displaying content that informs or engages website visitors. Press "
"releases, site announcements, and informal blog-like entries may all be "
"created with a <em>story</em> entry. By default, a <em>story</em> entry is "
"automatically featured on the site's initial home page, and provides the "
"ability to post comments."
